## ✅Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a loan portfolio to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) and uncover insights into lending trends, borrower demographics, and loan health. The analysis is driven by a data-first approach, utilizing Python and its robust data science libraries to deliver actionable business intelligence. The entire analysis, from data wrangling to visualization, was performed in a Jupyter Notebook, which is included in this repository.

#
### ✅Problem Statement & Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Total Loan Applications: Calculation of total applications and Month-to-Date (MTD) figures.
- Total Funded Amount: Calculation of total funds disbursed and MTD figures.
- Total Amount Received: Tracking of total repayments from borrowers and MTD figures.
- Average Interest Rate: Computation of the average interest rate across all loans to assess the overall cost of the lending portfolio.
- Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluation of the average DTI to gauge the financial health of borrowers.
